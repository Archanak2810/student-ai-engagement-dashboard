# **🗂️ Data Highlights**

•	Capture student details: name, college, stream, year, device, and state

•	Track AI tool usage: daily hours, use cases, preferred tools, trust levels, and impact on grades

•	Include awareness level, professor allowances, internet access, and willingness to pay

# **📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
•	Monitor total respondents, average daily usage, trust index, and willingness-to-pay %

•	Create derived fields, including Student Awareness Categories, for deeper insights

# **⚙️ Data Processing & Modeling**
•	Clean and standardize data: handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

•	Transform categorical data into numeric form (e.g., Yes/No → 1/0)

•	Structure data to calculate KPIs and enable interactive dashboard visualizations

# **📈 Visualization & Dashboard**
•	Build pivot tables to summarize by stream, college, AI tool, and other categories

•	Create charts to visualize trends, distributions, and comparisons (usage, trust, awareness, relations)

•	Add slicers for dynamic filtering by Academic Stream, Device used, and Trust in AI tools and Impact on Grades.

•	Highlight key metrics with KPI cards for at-a-glance insights

# **🎨 Dashboard Design**
•	Apply a clean, intuitive layout for easy navigation

•	Include interactive filters to simplify exploration of student AI tool data

•	Ensure usability for educators, policymakers, and EdTech stakeholders

# **❓ Data Exploration Questions**
The dashboard answers the following questions

1.	What is the share of each Preferred AI Tool among students?
   
3.	What is the average daily usage hours by Year of Study (1–4)?
   
5.	How does Daily Usage Hours relate to Impact on Grades? (with trendline)
   
7.	What is the distribution of Internet Access (Poor, Medium, High)?
   
9.	What is the average Trust in AI Tools by State?
